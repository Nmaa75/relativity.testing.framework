Complete the following tasks before merging in your PR:
- [ ] If this is a user facing change, update [version.txt](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/blob/master/version.txt) and [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] If this is a major version bump, make sure to build a new version of Relativity.Testing.Framework.RingSetup referencing this new major version (If you are expecting a subsequent Relativity.Testing.Framework.Api major version bump, it might be better to do these at the same time).
