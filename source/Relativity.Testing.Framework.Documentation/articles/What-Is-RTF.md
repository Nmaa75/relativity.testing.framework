Relativity Testing Framework is a framework that assists with testing Relativity. 
It provides methods for setup and teardown of test objects in a way that is agnostic to the version of Relativity that you are testing against.

It has two main components to it:
1. Configuration management
2. DTOs/Models

While these two components provide some value on their own, they're much more useful when used in conjunction with other Relativity Testing Framework packages, such as [Relativity Testing Framework API](https://github.com/relativityone/relativity.testing.framework.api/wiki).
